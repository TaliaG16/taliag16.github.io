    <p>My name is Talia Goody and I am a senior at Mission Vista High School. In my free time,
         I enjoy playing video games and drawing. Of course, I also have a passion for coding.
         I am currently taking Web Programming and Computer Game Programming classes in order
         to pursue my career as computer scientist.</p>

    <h3>My Work Experience</h3>

    <br>
    <p>I work part-time as a bagger at the Commissary, a grocery store on Camp Pendleton dedicated 
        to supporting military families. It is my responsibility to bag costumers' items, assisting
        them outside whenever requested, and cleaning my workspace after each day.</p>

    <br>
    <p>I have also taken part of the Code Queens hackathon, in which I was responsible for creating 
        an app to help those in need during the holiday season. As my teammates had little to no 
        prior coding experience, I made sure to assit them with any issues they came across. I also 
        took charge of organizing the requirements for our app and assigning tasks.</p>

    <h3>My Volunteer Work</h3>
    <img src = "https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/San-Diego-blood-bank.png" class="blood">
    <br>
    <p>I also have been a part of local events in Oceanside. I have assisted with the Oceanside
        Turkey Trot and Bike the Coast events, where I handed out items to participants. I also 
        recently donated blood for the first time for the San Diego Blood Bank blood drive held
        at my school.
